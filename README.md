## How to Install
Copy all the folders to the root Essentials folder, then run the game.

## How to Customize
There are four options inside `UILoad` that allows you to customize it a little more:
* `SHOW_GENDER_COLOR` defines the color of player name. If true, the color will be blue or red; otherwise it'll be the same as the other text.
* `USE_CUSTOM_FONT` defines if the plugin will use a custom font located in Fonts folder.
* `CUSTOM_FONT_NAME` is the name of the font located in Fonts folder. Only works if `USE_CUSTOM_FONT` is set to `true`
* `CUSTOM_FONT_SIZE` is the size of your custom font. Only works if `USE_CUSTOM_FONT` is set to `true`
